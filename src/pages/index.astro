          The St. Augustine Music Festival produces, performs, and promotes inspiring, world-class music to a diverse
          audience in an accessible, welcoming environment to enhance the quality of life and further the sense of
          connection within the community. At SAMF, we entertain, educate, and elevate through music. We entertain our
          audience with positive, inspiring, and creative musical performances. We educate our audience through lectures
          and discussions to gather insight into chosen musical selections, gain exposure to new ideas or concepts, and
          cultivate new talent in schools, organizations, and collaborations. We elevate our audience on the emotional
          and spiritual levels through the memorable and joyful experience of sharing world-class musical performances.

          It has been proven in the scientific and medical fields that listening to classical music results in mental
          and physical benefits â€“ such as improved sleep quality, reduction of stress, better pain management, and
          positive effects on mood, productivity, and creativity. Plus, participating in a quality event that promotes a
          joyful, enriching, and memorable experience close to home in a neighborly environment will deepen and
          strengthen the bond within the community for years to come.
